# Algorithms in Python

A collection of algorithms implemented in Python with the primary goals of:

- Learning Python
- Learning Graph Theory
- Picking up useful knowledge as part of my university module: 'AI for Games'

Algorithms currently implemented:

- Depth First Search (DFS) | (non-weighted, non-directional, iterative)
