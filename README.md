# Algorithms in Python

A collection of algorithms implemented in Python with the primary goals of:

- Learning Python
- Learning Graph Theory
- Picking up useful knowledge as part of my university module: 'AI for Games'

Algorithms currently implemented:

- Depth First Search (DFS) | (straight forward graph data implementation)
- Breadth First Search (BFS) | (straight forward graph data implementation)
- Minimax with Alpha / Beta pruning | (Simple version of Tic Tac Toe, unbeatable)
- (not finished) A* pathfinding | Snake, pygame implementation
