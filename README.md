# Algorithms

A collection of algorithms implemented in Python & C++ with the primary goals of:

- Learning Python
- Learning Graph Theory
- Picking up useful knowledge as part of my university module: 'AI for Games'

Algorithms currently implemented:

- Depth First Search (DFS) | straight forward graph data implementation
- Breadth First Search (BFS) | straight forward graph data implementation
- Binary Search | Basic implementation in C++
- Quicksort | Basic implementation in C++
- Minimax with Alpha / Beta pruning | Simple version of Tic Tac Toe, unbeatable
- (not finished) A* pathfinding | Snake, pygame implementation
