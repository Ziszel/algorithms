# A* Pathfinding in Snake

This repository holds my assignment 2, AI for Games (2023) project.

This project is a demonstration of A* pathfinding to play the game Snake. I have used Python and Pygame. 

By default the player can control the blue and white snake, but it is possible to set both snakes to AI so that they can play each other.

The speed of the game can be set by updated the FPS variable.
